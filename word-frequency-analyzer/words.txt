Text File Formatting Guidelines:
Words shall matched according to regular expression pattern shown during program initiation. Capitilization may affect frequency results based on
case-sensitivity option selected during program initiation. Program checks that the total number of words comprising the text file is a value
that can be cast from a size_t to int without loss of data.


Four Conditions for Mutual Exclusion:
no assumptions on the speed or number of processors or cores;
no two processes shall be simultaneously inside their critical sections;
no process running outside its critical section shall block another process;
no process shall wait indefinitely to enter its critical section.
